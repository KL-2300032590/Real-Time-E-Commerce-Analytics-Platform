Deployment Note:
This project was not deployed publicly because it relies on Apache Kafka, which requires a multi-node distributed setup (brokers, Zookeeper/Quorum, networking, persistent volumes). Hosting Kafka on free-tier cloud platforms like Railway/Render is not feasible due to resource constraints and container lifecycle limits.
In local development, Kafka runs reliably using Docker, but cloud deployment would require a paid managed Kafka service (Confluent Cloud / Redpanda Cloud / Upstash Kafka).
To keep the project cost-efficient, the deployment was limited to local and Docker-based execution.
